## 💡 Project Motivation

Gait — the way we walk — is a crucial indicator of health and mobility.
Current gait-analysis systems are often expensive and confined to labs.
This project provides a low-cost, portable, and open-source alternative that enables real-time gait tracking and visualization using embedded sensors and custom signal-processing algorithms.

Main Components

Embedded Layer:
Captures real-time motion data (acceleration, angular velocity).

Communication Layer:
Sends sensor data to the host PC via serial or wireless link.

Software Layer:
Performs signal filtering, gait-phase detection, feature extraction, and visualization.

# 🧰 Installation
1. Clone the repository
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/salaheldeenyasser/Gait-Monitoring-System.git
cd Gait-Monitoring-System
'''
2. Set up Arduino

Open the Arduino code from /Arduino/.

Connect your microcontroller.

Select the correct board and port.

Upload the sketch.

3. Set up Processing

Open the Processing script from /Processing/.

Adjust the COM port and baud rate in the code to match your Arduino.

Run the sketch to start data visualization.

## 🚀 Usage Guide

Mount the IMU on your foot, ankle, or shin securely.

Connect your microcontroller to your PC or via Bluetooth.

Open the Processing app to start visualizing motion data.

Walk naturally — the system will detect gait phases and plot live graphs.

Optionally, record the data for later analysis.

## 🔍 Data Processing Pipeline
Step	Operation	Description
1	Signal Acquisition	Collect raw sensor data (acc, gyro)
2	Filtering	Apply low-pass filter to remove noise
3	Segmentation	Detect gait cycles using peaks/zero crossings
4	Feature Extraction	Calculate stride length, cadence, gait symmetry, etc.
5	Visualization	Display real-time plots and statistics
## 📊 Results & Visualization

The Processing interface provides:

Real-time acceleration and orientation graphs

Detected gait phases and cycle count

Live numerical metrics (cadence, step duration)

Option to export logs for offline study

(Insert screenshots or graphs here)

## 🧭 Future Improvements

Add machine learning models to classify gait abnormalities.

Improve calibration for different body placements.

Support wireless streaming (ESP8266 / BLE).

Develop a mobile app for remote monitoring and data logging.

Integrate cloud storage and dashboards for therapists and researchers.
